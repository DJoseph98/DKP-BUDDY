Personnal project to deep understanding nodeJS and help a friend of mine.

The purpose was to create a web application tool to managing points earned by players from my personnal World of Warcraft guild.

It help the Raid Leader to manage points earned by players and item prices.

The data was updated by a LUA file from a video game addon and imported in the web application.

Each players has its own point and every items in the game have its own price.

To reach the goal I used some cool features like :

- Express for the server
- Handlebar for template rendering
- PassportJs for the authentification rules
- ORM Sequelize to manage data from database.
- lua2json to generate JSON data from LUA file.
